ADflow is a flow solver developed by the MDO Lab at the University of Michigan.
It solves the compressible Euler, laminar Navier–Stokes and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations using structured multi-block and overset meshes.
ADflow's features include the following:

- Discrete adjoint implementation
- "Complexified" code for complex-step derivative verification
- Massively parallel (both CPU and memory scalable) implementation using MPI

ADflow has been used in aerodynamic, aerostructural, and aeropropulsive design optimization of aircraft configurations.
Furthermore, we used ADflow to perform design optimization of hydrofoils and wind turbines.
