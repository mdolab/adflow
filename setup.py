      long_description="""ADflow is a multi-block structured flow solver developed by the MDO Lab at the University of Michigan.
      It solves the compressible Euler, laminar Navier-Stokes and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations.
      ADflow's features include the following:

      - Discrete adjoint implementation
      - "Complexified" code for complex-step derivative verification
      - Massively parallel (both CPU and memory scalable) implementation using MPI.
