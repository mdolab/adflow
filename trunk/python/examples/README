SERIAL VERSION
--------------
1) Build auxiliar libraries (order is relevant)
1.1) Build the SU_MPI library in serial mode
     Edit config and Common files, "make clean", "make"
1.2) Build the ADT library
     Edit config and Common files, "make clean", "make"

In the SUmb root:
2) Edit to SUmb_Common.mk file to use a serial version
3) Clear objects "make clean"
4) Compile everything "python setup.py build"

In this directory:
5) Run the examples
5.1) Steady "python simple.py"
5.2) Unsteady "python simple_unsteady.py"

PARALLEL VERSION
----------------
1) Build auxiliar libraries (order is relevant)
1.1) Build the SU_MPI library in parallel mode
     Edit config and Common files, "make clean", "make"
1.2) Build the ADT library
     Edit config and Common files, "make clean", "make"

In the SUmb root:
2) Edit to SUmb_Common.mk file to use a parallel version
3) Clear objects "make clean"
4) Compile everything "python setup.py build"

In this directory:
5) Run the examples
5.1) Steady "mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/bin/pyMPI simple.py"
5.2) Unsteady "mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/bin/pyMPI simple_unsteady.py"
