# Input files used by regression tests and some examples have to be downloaded

The input files for test need to be downloaded.

From the command line, navigate to the `adflow/python` directory and download and extract the archive

wget http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/sites/default/files/mdolabwebsite/repos/adflow/adflow_input_files.tar.gz
tar -xzvf adflow_input_files.tar.gz 

The above should extract the files to the `adflow/python/inputFiles` directory.
