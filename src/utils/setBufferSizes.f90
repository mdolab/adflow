!      * setBufferSizes determines the size of the send and receive     *
!      * buffers for this grid level. After that the maximum value of   *
!      * these sizes and the currently stored value is taken, such that *
!      * for all mg levels the same buffer can be used. Normally the    *
!      * size on the finest grid should be enough, but it is just as    *
!      * safe to check on all mg levels. A distinction is made between  *
!      * 1 to 1 and sliding mesh communication, because these happen    *
!      * consecutively and not simultaneously. Consequently the actual  *
!      * buffer size is the maximum of the two and not the sum.         *
!      * For steady state computations a mixing plane boundary          *
!      * condition is used instead of a sliding mesh. However, both     *
!      * communication patterns are allocated and initialized.          *
!      * Therefore the maximum of the two can be taken without checking *
!      * the situation we are dealing with.                             *
