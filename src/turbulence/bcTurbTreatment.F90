!
!       bcTurbTreatment sets the arrays bmti1, bvti1, etc, such that   
!       the physical boundary conditions are treated correctly.        
!       It is assumed that the variables in blockPointers already      
!       point to the correct block.                                    
!       The turbulent variable in the halo is computed as follows:     
!       wHalo = -bmt*wInternal + bvt for every block facer. As it is   
!       possible to have a coupling in the boundary conditions bmt     
!       actually are matrices. If there is no coupling between the     
!       boundary conditions of the turbulence equations bmt is a       
!       diagonal matrix.
