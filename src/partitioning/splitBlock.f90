       subroutine splitBlock(compBlock, nSub, nCells, ranges)
!
!       splitBlock tries to split the given computational block into   
!       the desired number of subblocks nSub. However it can happen    
!       that nSub is a strange number and a different splitting is     
!       performed. On return, nSub contains the actual number into the 
!       block is split. This number is smaller or equal to nSub on     
!       entry. As it is possible that the computational block itself   
!       is a subblock of an original cgns block, on return ranges will 
!       contain the nodal ranges of the subblocks in the original cgns 
!       block. The splitting attempts to keep the needed multigrid     
!       capabilities as much as possible.                              
!       A recursive bisection algorithm is used.
