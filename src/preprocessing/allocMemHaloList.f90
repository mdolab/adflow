       subroutine allocMemHaloList(level)
!
!       allocMemHaloList allocates the memory for the variables        
!       needed to construct the communication lists and the periodic   
!       information. These variables are located in the module         
!       haloList. Only the 1st level halo variables are allocated here 
!       to avoid unnecessary memory usage. The 2nd level cell halo     
!       are allocated later on in init2ndLevelCellHalos.
