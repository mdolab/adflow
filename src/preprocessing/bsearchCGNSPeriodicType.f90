       function bsearchCGNSPeriodicType(key, base, nn)
!
!       bsearchCGNSPeriodicType returns the index in base where key    
!       is stored. A binary search algorithm is used here, so it is    
!       assumed that base is sorted in increasing order. In case key   
!       appears more than once in base, the result is arbitrary.       
!       If key is not found, a zero is returned.
