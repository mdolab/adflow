!      * This module contains the variables used to handle the          *
!      * kill signals from the user. The user can send two signals that *
!      * can be processed by the code, namely kill -USR1 and kill -USR2.*
!      * The former signal will cause the program to dump a solution    *
!      * File after the current iteration, the latter will dump a       *
!      * solution file and the computation will be stopped. The         *
!      * definition of iteration is different for steady and unsteady.  *
!      * For steady it means after the current multigrid iteration, for *
!      * unsteady after the current time step.                          *
!      *                                                                *
!      * The handling can be switched off at compile time using the     *
!      * compiler flag -DUSE_NO_SIGNALS.                                *
