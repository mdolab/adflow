       module monitor
!
!       This module contains the variables to be monitored during the  
!       convergence as well as the arrays to store the convergence.    
!       The latter are only allocated by processor 0.                  
!       The default variables to be monitored depend on the governing  
!       equations to be solved.

       ! nMonSum: Number of monitoring variables for which the sum over

       !          integer, because of MPI.
       ! nMonMax: Number of monitoring variables for which the maximum
       !          over all processors must be taken. Note that this is
       !          an integer, because of MPI.
