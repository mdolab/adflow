!       the original version has been nuked since the computations are
!       no longer necessary when calling from python
!       this is the most compliclated routine in all of adflow. it is
!       stupidly complicated. this is most likely the reason your
!       derivatives are wrong. you don't understand this routine
!       and its effects.
!       this routine *requries* the following as input:
!       mach, pinfdim, tinfdim, rhoinfdim, rgasdim (machcoef non-sa
!        turbulence only)
!       optionally, pref, rhoref and tref are used if they are
!       are non-negative. this only happens when you want the equations
!       normalized by values other than the freestream
!      * this routine computes as output:
!      *   muinfdim, (unused anywhere in code)
!         pref, rhoref, tref, muref, timeref ('dimensional' reference)
!         pinf, pinfcorr, rhoinf, uinf, rgas, muinf, gammainf and winf
!         (non-dimensionalized values used in actual computations)
