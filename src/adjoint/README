Readme file for the ADjoint

Here is a list of changes made to the original source code to accomodate the ADjoint

In /preprocessing/checkSymmetry.f90

comment out lines 187-198. These lines update the symmetry plane normal to the subface average. This violates the reduced stencil approximation of the ADjoint and has to be removed for consistancy.


In /preprocessing/xHalo.f90

modify subface normal computation to include only the nearest +- 2 cell normals. This allows the computation to fit inside the ADjoint stencil...
