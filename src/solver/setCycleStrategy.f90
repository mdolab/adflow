       subroutine setCycleStrategy

!       setCycleStrategy sets the multigrid cycling strategy for the   
!       multigrid level groundLevel. It is cycle strategy for the      
!       fine grid cut off at the current grid level. If the grid level 
!       is not in the range of the fine grid cycle strategy, cycling   
!       will be set to a single grid strategy.
