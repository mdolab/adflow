       ! Determine the interpolation pattern for both parts of the
       ! interface. The distinction between part 1 and part 2 is the
       ! sign of the group number. For part 1 the group number is
       ! minus the slide id and for part 2 the group number has a
       ! positive sign. This means that both parts can be built with
       ! the identical routine, except that the slide id's of the
       ! donor and halo must be reversed.
