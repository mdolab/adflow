    The separation values for the given surface is provided by this cost function.
    See :cite:t:`Kenway2017b` for more details.

sepsensorks:
  desc: >
    The separation sensor value based on the KS aggregation for the given surface is provided by this cost function.
    We first compute the deviation of the local velocity from the projected freestream on the desired surface. 
    Then, we use a trigonometric function to compute the sensor by providing an allowable flow deviation angle from this projected vector. 
    As a result, the sensor provides values form 1 to `-.inf`. 
    Any values that are greater than 0 are out of the alowable flow deviation.
    Thus, to constraint the separation, we use KS aggregation to find the maximum value in the sensor and can constraint it to be less than or equal to 0.

cavitation:

    It is a modified Heaviside function accounting for how much :math:`-C_p` exceeds the cavitation number over the given surface family.
    The ``computeCavitation`` flag must be set to `True` because this introduces additional computations.
    The most common use case of this cost function involves constraining it over a specific surface family, not all walls.

cpmin:
  desc: >
    Minimum coefficient of pressure (:math:`C_p`) over the given surface family.
    This function is computed with Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser (KS) function aggregation resulting in a conservative constraint because the ``cpmin`` outputted will always be more negative than the true :math:`C_{p,min}`.
    The ``computeCavitation`` flag must be set to ``True`` because this introduces additional computations involving global communications across processors.
    If ``False``, the returned value is zero.

    The pressure is calcualted as the difference of the pressure on the wall and the free stream pressure.
    For closed surfaces, the free stream pressure delta will cancel and the resulting force calculation is correct.
    However, integrating the force on open surfaces will not result in the free stream static pressure contribution cancelling out.
