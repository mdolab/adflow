Developers Guide
================

This guide is intended to be used by developers of ADflow. Higher level descriptions of the code itself can be found here.

Adjoint
-------

.. toctree::

    adjoint
    

Differentiation 
---------------

.. toctree::

    autodiff




Extra Stuff
-----------

Triangles of zipper mesh live only in the root processor.

``surfaceIntegration.F90``: Takes care of forces and flow-through integrations. User-defined surfaces can only be used for flow-through integrations

We only assemble the full Jacobian for preconditioner. The adjoint is matrix-free. In the future we need a matrix-free preconditioner to avoid memory limitations.

Overset interpolation is in the ``wOversetGeneric`` subroutine, located in ``src/utils/haloExchange.F90``.
