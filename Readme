This is the ADflow README. Please read this before trying to compile.


----------------
Prerequisites:
-----------------
See the MDOLab website for setting up the prerequresites. 

---------------------
   ADflow -- Build
---------------------

   With all the prerequisites installed ADflow can now be compiled. To
   begin type:

   $ make

   A set of instructions on how to setup a config files will be
   displayed. Do as requested and modify the config.mk file
   accordingly. 

   Then re-run 

   $ mkae

   If this is successful and the end of output contains

   "module adflow was successfully imported"

   The ADflow build was successful and we're done.

   If there was an issue compiling it will be necessary to modify the
   config file.

---------------------
     ADflow -- Verify
---------------------

    ADflow contains a set of simple tests that can be run automatically
    to ensure ADflow reproduces the expected reference results. You should
    a diff-viewer installed. xxdiff is used by default which can be installed
    using 

    $ sudo apt-get install xxdiff

    Change to the regression tests directory at:
    $ cd python/reg_tests/

    Command line arguemnts for run_reg_tests.py can be found by running:

    $ python run_reg_tests.py --help

    To run all regression tests, now simply run:
    
    $ python run_reg_tests.py

    
    If the tests are successful a 'adflow: Success!' message
    will be printed, otherwise a diff window will appear hihglighting
    the differences between the reference case and the most recently
    completed verification run.

---------------------
     ADflow -- Complex
---------------------
	
    ADflow contains scripts to automatically build a "complexified"
    version of ADflow directly from the real version.

    ADflow_CS REQUIRES a complex build of petsc to build and run. The
    petsc configuration script must be re-run with the following
    options:

   $ ./configure --with-shared-libraries --download-superlu_dist=yes --download-parmetis=yes --download-metis=yes --with-fortran-interfaces=1 --with-debuggig=yes --with-scalar-type=complex --PETSC_ARCH=complex-debug

   Follow instructions as before to complete complex build. 

   Now, to build complex ADflow do:

   $ export PETSC_ARCH=complex-debug
   $ make -f Makefile_CS <ARCH>

   where arch is the same architecture used for the real version. Note
   that the correct, complex PETSC_ARCH MUST be set before the code is
   compiled and also must be set when running in complex mode.
